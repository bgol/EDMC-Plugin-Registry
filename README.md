# EDMC-Plugin-Registry
The official centralized plugin registration repository for the EDMC Plugin Browser.

## What is this repository?

This repository contains a list of plugins that have been registered with the EDMC team, and are supported by the current versions of EDMC. This is a voluntary registry to help highlight the wonderful world of EDMC plugins, and allow users to discover more useful plugins. 

## Register a Plugin
Are you a plugin author? Do you want your plugin to be listed in the plugin browser? Check out [STANDARDS](/docs/STANDARDS.md) to view the requirements for listing, and then head on over to [CONTRIBUTING](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) to view the steps to register a plugin.

## Users
EDMC 6.1.0 and later include the plugin browser by default - check it out and see what plugins might be right for you in the Settings menu.

## Reporting Issues
Is a plugin misbehaving? Is there something we don't know about but should? Please report it to us in a bug report so we can investigate.
